            <p><em>&ldquo;Dying is a wild night and a new road.&rdquo; &ndash; Emily Dickinson</em></p>
            <p>Throughout history, authors and poets have extensively exploited the expressive power of metaphors in their works to convey certain feelings or attitudes as demonstrated by the line from Dickinson above. Artists have extensively used metaphorical symbols in their artworks to achieve similar tasks. However, starting from the late 80s, breakthroughs in the field of Cognitive Science have suggested that metaphors are more than literary and artistic tools &ndash; they are the building blocks of our perception and understanding of the world. As early as c.335 BC, Aristotle noted in his <em>Poetics </em>that &ldquo;A 'metaphorical term' involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something else.&rdquo; (Aristotle, c.335 BC/1972) Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of the &lsquo;metaphorical term&rsquo; is general and not limited to the realm of the arts; it simply suggested that one term can be applied to another. It was not until more than 2,000 years later that his ideas would be empirically elaborated and tested.</p>
            <p>In 1980, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson published their magnum opus <em>Metaphors We Live By</em>, which established and extensively explored what is now known as the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT). Lakoff and Johnson suggested that humans naturally understand an abstract concept in terms of some other concept that is more concrete and accessible as the core idea of their theory. The most concrete and basic knowledge of concepts is derived through embodied experiences such as grasping a cup and jumping up and down. The mapping between different concepts is defined as a &ldquo;conceptual metaphor&rdquo;, and conceptual metaphors help us break down high-level abstract concepts into more basic ones and thus facilitate our understanding of the world. (Johnson &amp; Lakoff 1980)</p>
            <p>To illustrate their point, Lakoff and Johnson gave the &ldquo;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">argument</span> is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">war</span>&rdquo; metaphor as an example. Since <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">argument</span> is an abstract concept, our brain partially structures the understanding of it in terms of a relatively more concrete concept that shares structural similarities&mdash;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">war</span>. This is why expressions such as &ldquo;He <em>attacked </em>his opponent&rsquo;s positions&rdquo;, &ldquo;She <em>stood her ground</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;Their points were <em>weak</em>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;She <em>won</em> the argument&rdquo; are construed as normal expressions. Of course, what is considered normal is dependent on the larger culture that an individual is situated in. In a pacifist culture where <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">war</span> is an obsolete concept, such expressions would most likely not be considered as normal, perhaps the concept of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">argument</span> as we know it would not even exist.</p>
            <p>The CMT was actually subtly hinted to in a quote by the semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce (pronounced 'PURSS') more than a century before its establishment: &ldquo;To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is <strong>but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another</strong>, or that all thought is in signs.&rdquo; (Peirce 1868)</p>
            <p>Loosely speaking, this is Peirce&rsquo;s definition of a <em>sign</em>:</p>
            <p>something <br /> that is determined by the <em>object</em> that it represents and<br /> produces a mental structure, which Peirce calls the <em>interpretant</em>, <br /> that resembles the sign<br /> to the interpreting agent.</p>
            <p>Three terms were italicized because they form the core of Peirce&rsquo;s theory of signs. Note that the term <em>object</em> here need not refer to something physical, it can also be an abstract, dynamic process such as feeling an emotion, or even another sign. In an early account in the development of his semiotic theory, Peirce grouped all signs into three basic kinds: icons, indices, and symbols.(Peirce 1868) Even though Peirce continued to develop his classification of signs later on, these three classes stayed at the basis of describing the relationship between a sign and an object. An <em>icon </em>represents an object by means of structural similarity; a light and rapidly ascending piano passage can said to be iconic for the ascension of a lark. An <em>index </em>represents an object by means of causal and existential connection; smoke can be said to be indexical of fire. A <em>symbol </em>represents an object by means of some norm in agreement of what it might mean; most words in human languages are symbolic of the concepts that they represent. In terms of CMT, the way that conceptual metaphors take place is for a sign to refer to another sign, as opposed to a direct connection to an object&mdash;especially so when the incident sign is complex and abstract. For instance, the symbolic sign given by the English word &ldquo;argument&rdquo; may give rise to the concept <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">argument</span> (the interpretant) that serves as an iconic sign that refers to the concept of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">war</span> which may point to some other sign; this chain of references, once terminated, can be taken to be the object of the word &ldquo;argument&rdquo;, though it may likely be a very low-level, concrete concept and thus obscured and unnoticeable for our high-level, abstract minds. This ability for a sign to refer to another is what the UC Berkeley Professor of Anthropology and Cognitive Science Terrence Deacon attributes to be responsible for the development of complex linguistic capabilities, which is not observed in any other species. (Deacon 1997 Ch.3)</p>
            <p>Given the broad range of forms that a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; can be in, I will focus on one of them to illustrate how signs make up our understanding of the world. Music, especially Classical Music, is full of icons and indices that are extremely powerful in conveying what symbols in our daily language cannot. Of course, there are symbols in music as well. National anthems are great examples, where these songs are agreed upon to stand for their nations. However, when a melody just &ldquo;sounds like&rdquo; it belongs to a certain culture due to historical reasons, it can also serve as a symbol&mdash;take Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s &ldquo;Russian&rdquo; theme at the beginnings of his 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Piano Concertos, for example.</p>
            <p>Lawrence Zbikowski, a Professor of Music at the University of Chicago, organized music into <em>sonic analogs</em>, or musical elements that serve as Peircean signs. (Zbikowski 2017) Zbikowski referred to the functioning of music as <em>analogical reference</em> in contrast to <em>symbolic reference</em> of language. The most basic sonic analogs are arranged and manipulated by other sonic analogs to create meaning on the macroscopic scale as well as the microscopic scale. For instance, a base sonic analog may simply be a sequence of notes without a temporal dimension. Then a simple rhythm &ndash; another sonic analog &ndash; may be applied to it to make it feel like something. If the sequence of notes were based on a major scale, and the rhythm takes on a dotted form, the combined sonic analog would invoke the feeling of happiness and robustness, among several possibilities. Then, this now temporally ordered sequence of notes can be harmonized, dynamized, or conjoined with another sequence of notes, among numerous possibilities.</p>
            <p>The combination of sonic analogs can sometimes produce emergent properties&mdash;that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole&mdash;but this process is highly unpredictable and can often depend on the individual. For instance, it makes sense that individuals with failed romantic relationships are more sensitive to loss and grief in music. Large works in western Classical Music often involve layers upon layers of sonic analogs in this view, and this is the reason why they hold the power they do. Indeed, a thorough analysis of sophisticated music using this framework will require a separate article due to its complexity.</p>
            <p>Having provided this framework, Zbikowski further explains the mechanism that underlies it by invoking Lawrence Barsalou&rsquo;s theory of <em>perceptual symbols</em>. (Zbikowski 2017) The theory posits that the set of neurons that are fired upon receiving some perceptual information&mdash;touch, smell, etc.&mdash;is partially stored in what Barsalou calls the <em>conjunctive neurons</em>. (Barsalou 1999) When we are in need of recalling some perceptual information later in the absence of the source we obtained it from, the corresponding set of conjunctive neurons are activated to give us a partial simulation of the original source. The partial information stored is termed <em>perceptual symbol</em>. And the conjunctive neurons are termed <em>simulators.</em> When we perceive some sonic analog, we search in our simulators for a relevant experience and map from that experience to the sonic analog to give it meaning. Note that this explanation using perceptual symbols fits perfectly in CMT, where cognition is grounded in embodied experiences. This correspondence has an interesting implication: carefully designed music can invoke similar responses in a large number of audience while individuality in interpretation is not lost. Similar responses are invoked because all of us live by the same laws of physics, and most of us live by the same schedule of working and sleeping, and general progression through life from childhood to old-age, to name a few obvious commonalities. Individuality is not lost because it is extremely unlikely that someone has the exact same set of embodied experiences as another, no matter how small the difference can be. This characteristic is in direct contrast with language, where everyone abides by the same rules of grammar and semantics, and individuality is minimized.</p>
            <p>Considering language and music from a functional approach, the aforementioned difference is easily explained. Language is meant to specify relationships between objects, ideas and people as precisely as possible while music is not. Therefore, language needs a set of precise rules and definitions that serve as a mental apparatus that deconstructs language received from external sources&mdash;we call this <em>grammar</em>&mdash;and music does not. Instead, music&rsquo;s &ldquo;grammar&rdquo; would perhaps consist of Barsalou&rsquo;s perceptual symbols and embodied experiences. This is key to the expressive power of music, and why music is particularly effective at communicating emotions. This is also perhaps why it often takes people a considerable amount of time to describe how a piece of music makes them feel&mdash;even if they are very intelligent. Our languages differ from music in a determinedly functional manner. This difference is deep and intrinsic and results from the two communicative media&rsquo;s different places on the icon-index-symbol spectrum. In a way, they are complementary.</p>
            <p>Lakoff also applied CMT to the development and understanding of mathematics in <em>Where Mathematics Comes From</em> (2000), and I took inspirations from this book to apply CMT to the understanding of Physics as well. These subjects deserve their own articles and will not be thoroughly explored here.</p>
            <p>Having acquainted CMT, it is important to draw some inferences about what the CMT implies. Assuming the validity of CMT, it follows that our minds are rigid hierarchical structures with abstract concepts at the top and concrete embodied experiences at the bottom, and we operate at the higher levels. Just think about it: people today are generally born into societies where most of the things they use and see have origins and underlying mechanisms that are nowhere close to being their concerns. A lot of people own and drive cars on a daily basis, but do they know how exactly a car works? Computers and the Internet are pervasive today, to say the least, but how many people would know how exactly they operate? How old were you when you first learned that plants appear to green because their chlorophylls only absorb EM radiation of wavelengths that do not correspond to the color we define as green? We are born into a world of blended ideas that are packed into simple and useful interfaces for our conceptual ease. Even in school, we are given mathematical formulas without really diving into their true meanings (no, deriving them is not equivalent to understanding them, see (Lakoff &amp; N&uacute;&ntilde;ez 2000, Part 6), though derivation sometimes helps with doing so). It is exactly the ability to make metaphorical mappings, blend concepts, and comprehend interfaces that enable us to achieve what no other species can. It is this ability that forcefully defines what it means to be human.</p>
