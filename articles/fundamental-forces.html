            <p>Approximately 13.8 billion years ago, an infinitely dense entity expanded into a steaming state at more than 1,000 times the temperature of the Sun’s core to create the universe—according to theory. This is known as the Big Bang, and it marks the start of time as we know it. The Big Bang gave rise to the four fundamental interactions that act as the basis of virtually every single phenomenon that we have managed to discover: the Weak Interaction, the Strong Interaction, the Electromagnetic Interaction, and the Gravitational Interaction.</p>
            <p>During the first 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds after the Big Bang, the universe we observe today had a size comparable to that of an electron: on the order of ~10<sup>-15</sup> m. The four fundamental interactions of nature were united into one under the extreme temperature and gravitational pressure of the entity. The theory of General Relativity fail to model the behavior of the universe during this time due to complicated interactions between fluctuations in energy and Gravity on such microscopic scales. This period of time is known as the Planck Epoch. After this transient, the Gravitational Interaction first separated from the united interaction, then the Strong and lastly the Electromagnetic. The four fundamental interactions started to take forms in the way we experience them today as the universe started to cool from the blazing state.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>The Gravitational</strong></p>
            <p>In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton presented his Law of Universal Gravitation in his magnum opus <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>. It postulated a mutual force of attraction between any two bodies, proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them, and that Gravity is infinitely ranged. Though mostly accurate, Newton did not hit the bullseye of Gravity.&nbsp;The phenomenon of Apsidal Precession, which was observed after Newton&rsquo;s lifetime, was not explained by his law; the degree to which light bends when passing near celestial bodies is also incorrectly given by the law. &nbsp;It was not until more than two centuries later did Albert Einstein publish his papers on the theory of General Relativity in 1915, which revealed more accurately the mechanisms of gravity. Paul Dirac, a fundamental figure in the development of Quantum Mechanics, described General Relativity as &ldquo;the greatest scientific discovery that was ever made&rdquo;. Improving on Newton&rsquo;s Law of Universal Gravitation, General Relativity asserted that Gravity is a manifestation of curvatures in space-time created by celestial bodies. The more massive the bodies, the larger the size of the curvature. Think of space-time as a piece of stretchable fabric with immense area, and a massive object will create a curvature on the fabric and cause surrounding objects to fall toward it. &nbsp;Though our species have been experiencing and interacting with Gravity since prehistoric times, its mysterious facade remains partially veiled, though less so than the other interactions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>The Weak </strong></p>
            <p>Despite its name, the Weak Interaction is much stronger than Gravity, but it is only effective at short distances, thus receiving its name. This interaction is extremely crucial to the structure of the universe in that most of the stars and heavy atoms would not exist if Weak Interaction was nonexistent. It is the only means by which quarks can change their flavors, and it thus has an important role in facilitating the transmutations of atoms and shaping the diversity of materials in our universe. One of the most common Weak Interactions is Beta Decay, the process by which a neutron in an atom transmutes into a proton by changing a down quark to an up quark and thus increasing an atom&rsquo;s atomic number; for instance, when a Phosphorus atom undergoes Beta Decay, it becomes a Sulfur atom. In addition, the proton-proton chain reactions that provide energy to the Sun are initiated by the Weak-Interaction-driven diprotic fusion that creates Deuterium. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the Weak Interaction is the only interaction that is known to violate the Charge-Parity symmetry. As one of the frontiers of Modern Physics, CP violation&rsquo;s mysterious ties to the Weak Interaction will be crucial to understanding the relationship between matter and antimatter. It is plausible that, if the Weak Interaction did not exist, or obeyed CP symmetry, the Big Bang would have generated equal amounts of matter and antimatter and the universe would have been nothing but matter-antimatter pair-annihilation. Though most of us do not directly interact with it in our lifetimes, the Weak Interaction is indubitably fundamental in our physical existences, and each informative interpretation of it had been a milestone in human history.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>The Strong</strong></p>
            <p>As its name suggests, it is the strongest interaction among the four, but it also has the shortest effective range&mdash;roughly equal to the diameter of a proton.&nbsp;Below the subatomic scale, the Strong Interaction is responsible for the formations of subatomic quark-containing particles of baryons and mesons as it mediates the Color Force between quarks. On the subatomic scale, the Strong Interaction mediates the binding force between particles in an atomic nucleus. On the scale of a nucleus, the proton-proton repulsion causes an acceleration on the order of 10<sup>29</sup> meters per second squared. Without the Strong Interaction to compensate, any nucleus would immediately fly apart upon formation, and there would not be any stable atoms in our universe at all. The mechanism underlying the Strong Interaction has been accurately modeled by exchange of massless particles that carry Color Charges called gluons, and the first experimental evidence of these predicted particles was presented in 1978 by the PLUTO detector at the DESY in Hamburg, Germany.&nbsp; <br /> </p>
            <p>Though termed with &ldquo;Charge&rdquo;, the Force produced by a Color Charge is very different from the Electric Force&mdash;it stays constant as distance increases. Such property is due to the fact that Color Force field lines do not span space radially like Electric Field lines. Instead, the gluon exchanges take place within only a very narrow tube-like shape of width around 1 femtometer. This characteristic of the gluon exchanges leads to the consequence that if two gluon-coupled quarks and/or antiquarks get separated far enough, it will be more energetically favored to form a new quark-antiquark pair than to break off the gluon coupling. This implies that no Color-carrying particle can be isolated from their coupling counterparts, and this phenomenon is called Color Confinement. More interestingly, the Color force actually decreases when quarks get close enough to each other such that there is a distance at which the quarks effectively experience no force from the Strong Interaction and are thus essentially free particles in that respect. This phenomenon is termed &ldquo;asymptotic freedom&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> Just like the Weak Interaction, the Strong Interaction is of crucial importance to the formation of the world as we know it today. Without it, our universe would be filled with a mess of wandering quarks.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>The Electromagnetic</strong></p>
            <p>Electromagnetism is about more than just a force: each successful exploitation of the properties of the Electric and Magnetic Fields had been a milestone in modern technology. With an effective distance and volume scale much larger than that of the Weak and Strong Interaction&rsquo;s and much smaller than that of Gravity&rsquo;s, Electromagnetism is indeed the most practical interaction for us in everyday life. Starting with Alessandro Volta&rsquo;s invention of the first electric battery, to Nicholas Callan&rsquo;s creation of the transformer that enabled efficient long-distance transmission of electricity, to Narinder Singh Kapany&rsquo;s ingenuity in Optical Fibers that allowed attenuation-free long-distance transmission of information, each advancement in applied Electromagnetism has played a role in bringing us better lives. Electromagnetism is mediated by the fields of Electrically and Magnetically charged objects. In fact, Electric and Magnetic fields are really different manifestations of the same entity, and their forms depend on the reference frames that observers assume. <br /> <br /> The field lines of electrically charged objects extend radially outwards like spokes on a wheel. When an electrically charged object is suddenly accelerated to a constant velocity from rest, the Electric Field from that particular charge everywhere obviously must change in direction and magnitude; however, the information that the charge has been accelerated cannot travel faster than the speed of light per Einstein&rsquo;s Special Relativity, so information about the change in the charge&rsquo;s position and velocity is transmitted via a disturbance in the Electric Field lines that expands outwards like a ripple in a pond at the speed of light in the medium that the charge is in. Moreover, the Maxwell&rsquo;s Equations tell us that this disturbance in Electric Field will also give rise to a coupling Magnetic Field, and together they will travel through space. This phenomenon is known as Electromagnetic Radiation. Many antennas, devices that emit EM radiation, can be modeled as oscillating electric dipoles with adjustable oscillatory frequencies. Visible light is a prime example of EM radiation, though it only makes up a fairly small portion of the full spectrum of EM radiation. &nbsp;One remarkable characteristic, out of several others, of EM radiation is that it carries energy through space at high velocities. Mobile phones, radios, Wi-Fi, microwaves etc. would all be infeasible if EM radiation carried no energy for some reason. Clearly, a considerable portion of today&rsquo;s technology is based on Electromagnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Quantum Field Theory, The Standard Model, and Unification</strong></p>
            <p>To understand our universe beyond the Big Bang, a unified description of the four fundamental interactions is needed to reach past the Planck Epoch, and physicists had spent much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century up to the present in search of such a description with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s, a group of physicists including Dirac, Fermi, and Born successfully developed a description of classical Electromagnetism as being mediated not by Electromagnetic fields but by abstract exchanges of massless photons between charges, which are really the excited states of an underlying field. This discovery led to the rise of the Quantum Field Theory where particles are described as excitations of the ground states of their corresponding underlying fields. <br /> <br /> In 1954, Chen-Ning Yang and Robert Mills came up with the famous Yang-Mills Field that laid the foundation for the development of a description of the Weak Interaction being mediated by particles now called W and Z bosons later in the 1960s. In 1964, Peter Higgs and two other independent groups of scientists came up with a pivotal theory that accounted for how the supposedly massless W and Z bosons gain mass via interaction with what is now called the Higgs Field.<br /> <br /> In the early 1970s, the Strong Interaction was found to be quantitatively predictable with an underlying field at least on short length scales due to Asymptotic Freedom, where, as discussed, the interaction is carried out by gluons.</p>
            <p>Together, these three interactions under the description by QFT make up the Standard Model of Physics, which has proved to be consistent with observations throughout the years. The Higgs Boson, which was the last piece of evidence needed to confirm the validity of the Standard Model was discovered at CERN in 2012. <br /> <br /> Physicists have been on the search for a QFT description of Gravity that would allow the unification of all four forces&mdash;the Theory of Everything. Various postulations of what is now called &ldquo;Superstring Theories&rdquo; have evolved into the M-Theory that holds potentials to describe Gravity as interactions of particles called gravitons. <br /> <br /> The journey through the Standard Model marked a nearly century-long marathon in which the most brilliant minds on Earth sought to unveil the unimaginable answers to questions that date back billions of years to the birth of the universe. It was a remarkable journey, and it will continue into the future with elegant uncertainty.</p>
