       Mind and Hand

       In my introductory computer science class, our professor asked us to always start approaching problems by writing out example input-output pairs. That is, given a description of the problem at hand, we had to come up with our own test cases for the answer algorithm before we actually implemented it. These test cases would then be verified by the solution algorithm that the teaching staff provided (not visible to us). The professor called this system

       Like most first-semester freshmen at my college, I thought I was too smart for something so slow and tedious. Sometimes finding an interesting test case took hours. I just wanted to finish the assignment as fast as possible to prove myself an intellectual. I thought, or rather refused to doubt, that I could understand problems perfectly at first pass, or maybe the second without additional work.

       One year later, I figured out why this approach worked well for teaching problem solving. Borrowing from psychology, any problem is represented in your mind as its “

       Since knowledge is acquired by having and interacting with accurate representations of the world, let’s focus on the representation part.

       Let’s consider a reasonably complex problem. The kind that requires you to actually think, and not just punch numbers into an equation. Unless you are a true genius, your problem space at

       By exploring the problem space with examples, we improve our understanding of the problem. More generally, by moving the hand, we enrich the mind. When exploring the

       I made this exact mistake once. When I started self-studying quantum mechanics from a textbook, I would just read and take notes without trying any of the exercises. On the one hand, I was just lazy. But on the other hand, I was also afraid that I wouldn’t be able to do the exercises – too hurtful for my youthful pride. Ironically, not doing the problems meant that I was not able to identify where my understanding was weak or inaccurate. This then made problems later on in the book impossible because I had a weak foundation from before. It formed a negative feedback loop, and my learning was going absolutely nowhere. It was only when I decided to complement the reading with a course and problem sets did I actually become more comfortable with the material. As a specific instance that still sticks with me years later, it was only when I showed that two commuting operators share a basis of eigenfunctions did I truly understand the underlying mathematics of the uncertainty principle.

       Exploring mental representations with examples and problems is but one case of what I call the “mind and hand” duality. Or rather, in classical philosophical thought, it is the dichotomy between
