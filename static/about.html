        <h1>About Jasper</h1>
        <p>The world is full of beautiful yet daunting mysteries. Math is my way of tackling them. I
          study <span class="emphasis">Applied Math</span> in connection to <span class="emphasis">Physics and
            Neuroscience</span> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> (class of
          2024). </p>
          
          <p> I am passionate about working on problems in <span class="emphasis">augmented & artificial intelligence</span>,
            <span class="emphasis">nuclear & renewable energy</span>, and all sorts of <span class="emphasis">dynamical systems</span> (e.g. brain, economy, fluids),
            and I am open to both industry and academia opportunities. </p>
            
          <!-- <p>I aim to understand physical and neural systems from first principles. An important part
            of this is to find bridges between different hierarchies of complexity -- atom to molecule,
            neuron to brain. Precise mathematical descriptions and rigorous quantitative
            methods go a long way toward these goals.</p>

          <p>I am also interested to explore and learn subjects beyond Math, Physics and
          Neuroscience â€” for example, cinematography, literature, design. What makes a good film, novel,
          or design at an artistic level? How might these relate to human neural structure at a scientific
          level? I believe that there is something to be learned in just almost anything. So I am always
          open to chatting and exchanging ideas! </p> -->
          
          <p>Outside of academic pursuits, I like to take photos and videos, watch movies, and spend too much
          time on picking outfits.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">My resume is available upon <a href="mailto:jiapeng_chen@brown.edu">request</a>.
          Please feel free to reach out!</p>
