The world is full of beautiful yet daunting mysteries, and Math is my way of tackling them. I study Applied Math in connection to Physics and Neuroscience at Brown University (class of 2024). I aim to understand physical and neural systems from first principles. An important part of this is to find bridges between different hierarchies of complexity -- atom to molecule, neuron to brain, person to society. Precise mathematical descriptions and rigorous quantitative methods go a long way toward these goals.

However, I am well interested to explore and learn subjects beyond Math, Physics and Neuroscience -- for example, cinematography, literature, design. What makes a good film, novel, or design at an artistic level? How might these relate to human neural structure at a scientific level? I believe that there is something to be learned in just almost anything. So I am always open to chatting and exchanging ideas!

Outside of academic pursuits, I like to take photos and videos, watch movies, and spend too much time on picking outfits.
