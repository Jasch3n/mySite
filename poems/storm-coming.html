            <p class="article-body">
                A cloud curiously wandered alone  <br>
                When it saw a man dressed in red <br>
                Lying on a sunlit meadow as bed. <br>
                Among the bright yellow flowers, <br>
                He claimed his throne. <br><br>

                The loners stared at each other <br>
                And did nothing but breathe; <br>
                The man tried to say something, beneath, <br>
                But gave up and turned towards the flowers <br>
                That reminded him of his brother. <br><br>

                A golden crown lay beside his head, <br>
                Which was now perfectly still <br>
                The cloud looked over the hill <br>
                And saw more men dressed in red <br>
                Lying on the sunlit meadow as bed. <br><br>
            </p>
